SAT Resource Hub
Overview

SAT Resource Hub is a full-stack web application developed to provide structured and focused preparation for the Digital SAT. The platform integrates subject breakdowns, guided content, and interactive timed assessments into a centralized digital environment.

Rather than functioning as a static information page, the system simulates elements of real testing conditions through timed quizzes and automated scoring. The project was designed not only as a study tool, but as a scalable academic platform capable of long-term expansion.

Motivation

The shift to the Digital SAT introduced structural and format changes that made preparation more fragmented for many students. Resources are often scattered across platforms, lacking organization and consistent feedback mechanisms.

This project was built to address that gap by creating a streamlined system that:

Organizes exam content clearly

Reinforces learning through structured practice

Simulates timed assessment environments

Provides immediate performance feedback

The goal was to combine academic insight with technical execution in a practical, student-centered application.
